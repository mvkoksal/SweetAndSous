# 3D-Style 2D Platformer – Sweet&Sous

This is a Unity project for a **3D-style 2D platformer** game that I’m developing as a side project.  

## Game Concept
Two chefs compete to **collect ingredients** and **battle each other** to be chosen by the gourmet.  

### Storyline
Players follow a fun, competitive storyline where each chef is trying to become the gourmet’s favorite. After each duel:  
- The winning chef gets access to **more ingredients** to create their dish  
- The goal is to craft the ultimate gourmet meal and win the competition  

## Features
- 3D-style graphics in a 2D platforming environment  
- Multiplayer-style chef battles  
- Ingredient collection and combat mechanics  
- Storyline-driven progression with rewards after each duel  

## Future Plans
- Add a **store** where players can customize their avatars and weapons  
- Implement a **leveling system** for the chefs  
- Expand the storyline and add more duel arenas  
- Introduce new ingredient types and special abilities  

## Notes
- This is a personal side project and currently in development  
- Features and mechanics are subject to change
